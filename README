________________________________________
1. Overview
The REC – Research Environment for Cartography is a web-based application designed to facilitate the evaluation and annotation of cartographic elements within images. It allows users to upload images, annotate specific areas using various tools, and export the annotated data in CSV format, along with corresponding screenshots. This tool is tailored for researchers and professionals in the fields of cartography, data visualization, and geographic information systems (GIS).

2. Target Audience
•	Researchers in cartography and GIS
•	Data visualization professionals
•	Academics and students in related fields

3. Key Functionalities
3.1 Image Upload and Management
•	Multiple Image Upload: Users can upload several images (e.g., maps, charts) for detailed analysis and annotation.
•	Single Image View: Each uploaded image is displayed one at a time for focused annotation.
3.2 Annotation Tools
•	Lasso Tool: A freehand selection tool that allows users to draw custom shapes around areas of interest.
•	Rectangle Tool: A standard tool for selecting rectangular areas on the image.
•	Eraser Tool: Enables users to remove previously made annotations.
•	Edit Tool: Allows users to adjust previously made selections.
3.3 Category Selection Users can categorize each selected area under one of the following categories:
•	Map
•	Data Visualization
•	Text
•	Illustration
3.4 Annotations and Selections
•	Selection Details: The application records detailed information about each selection, including position, size, and category.
•	Visual Highlighting: Selected areas are highlighted with distinct colors and semi-transparent fills for easy identification.
•	Automatic Numbering: Each selected area is automatically numbered within the image and in the corresponding CSV file, with non-selected space (White Space) assigned a number 0.
3.5 Navigation
•	Image Navigation: Users can easily navigate between images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. Annotations are saved before moving to the next image.
•	Reset Option: Users can reset annotations if needed.
3.6 Exporting Results
•	CSV Export: Users can export the annotation data for each image in CSV format. The CSV files include details such as image name, category, type of selection, coordinates/size, percentage of total area, and the white space calculation.
•	Screenshot Export: Annotated images can be downloaded as screenshots, including all annotations.
•	Batch Export: All CSV files and screenshots can be downloaded together in a ZIP file for comprehensive documentation.

4. User Interface
•	Home Page: Introduction to the application with an option to upload images.
•	Evaluation Page: The primary workspace where users can annotate images. The interface includes:
o	Canvas: Displays the current image and allows for annotations.
o	Category Selector: Dropdown menu to select the category for the annotation.
o	Tool Buttons: Buttons for Lasso, Rectangle, Eraser, and Edit tools.
o	Navigation Buttons: "Next Image" and "Previous Image" buttons for moving between images.
o	Results Button: Leads to the results page for exporting data.
•	Results Page: Users can download CSV files and screenshots for all annotated images. The page also includes options to review or restart the evaluation process.

5. Workflow
1.	Upload Images: Start by uploading images you wish to evaluate.
2.	Annotate Images: Use the Lasso, Rectangle, and Eraser tools to annotate areas of interest on each image, and assign categories to each annotation.
3.	Navigate Between Images: Use the navigation buttons to move between different images, ensuring all necessary annotations are made.
4.	Export Results: Once all annotations are complete, export the results as CSV files and screenshots. The CSV includes a summary of all annotations and the calculation of unmarked white space.
5.	Review or Reset: Users can choose to review their annotations or reset the process if needed.
